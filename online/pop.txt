Population:  25  unbound 5

pop conversion: 10 C

Scientist :   5  -> 50  research
Engineer  :   5  -> 50  production
Farmer    :   5  -> 50  food 
Miner     :   5  -> 50
Pilot     :   0 

1 Miner per Roidmining
3 Miner per Mine
6 Miner per core mine

pop growth = (food_prod - pop * 1.25)/10 ( -> am anfang 3 / tick )
    shrink = (pop - food_prod)/10

1 h research = 100 research
1 h contruction = 50 production / 50 research

Needs free engineers/scientist in production, resource, waves, pds, rc

Production to construct  pds, ship, scan:
